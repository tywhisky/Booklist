** DONE /Programming Elixir/ - Dave Thomas
:FINISHED_AT: [2022-6-23]
:THOUGHTS:

I have work with Elixir more than half of one year when I finished this book. So the first
half of the book was a bit basic for me. But even so, it solidified perception of Elixir,
especially the part of Macro.
All in all this is a book for both introduction and consolidation.
